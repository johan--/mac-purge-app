# Purge

**Free up your Mac. Safely.**

Purge scans your Mac for cache files and junk left behind by apps and development tools. It explains everything in plain English, tells you what is safe to delete, and never touches anything it is not sure about.

## Installation

### Step 1: Download
Click the download link above and download `Purge.dmg`

### Step 2: Install
Open `Purge.dmg` and drag Purge to your Applications folder

### Step 3: Open for the first time

Since Purge is not on the Mac App Store, macOS will block 
it the first time you try to open it.

**Here is how to open it:**

1. Double click Purge to open it — macOS will block it and 
   show a warning, that is expected
2. Open **System Settings** on your Mac
3. Go to **Privacy & Security**
4. Scroll down to the **Security** section
5. You will see **"Purge was blocked from use because it is 
   not from an identified developer"**
6. Click **Open Anyway**
7. Enter your Mac password if asked
8. Click **Open** in the final confirmation

You only need to do this once. After that it opens normally.

### Step 4: Grant Full Disk Access
Purge needs Full Disk Access to scan your cache folders.

1. Click **Open Privacy Settings** inside the app
2. Find Purge in the list
3. Turn on the toggle next to Purge
4. Come back to the app and click **I've granted access**

## How Purge identifies folders

Purge uses a local database of known cache folders to identify and categorize everything it finds. The resolution order is:

1. **Your manual overrides** — any category you set yourself always wins
2. **Saved categorizations** — previously identified folders are remembered
3. **Bundled database** — a curated `explanations.json` ships with the app
4. **Safety tier list** — pattern-based rules for common folder names

Folders that don't match any source are tagged "Not Sure" so you can review them yourself.

## Requirements

- macOS 13.0 or later
- Full Disk Access permission

---

## Privacy

Purge never sends your files or file contents anywhere. The optional anonymous telemetry feature only sends cache folder names to help improve identification. You can preview exactly what is sent before it goes anywhere, and it is always opt in.
